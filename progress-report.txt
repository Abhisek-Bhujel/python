We have configured ASST2, built the system, and fetched all necessary updates required for this project. We also created

a GitLab repository for collaborative work, pushed the initial commit, and confirmed that other teammates were able to 

successfully clone and sync the project. We then went through the entire assignment document as well as the relevant folders 

inside OS/161 to clearly understand the system-call and exception-handling goals for this project.

Under kern/userprog, we created six separate source files—getpid.c, getppid.c, fork.c, execv.c, waitpid.c, and exit.c—each 

dedicated to one system call to maintain modularity and keep our implementation clean. We added these files to 

kern/userprog/files.mk and included the matching function declarations in kern/include/syscall.h. We also reviewed the OS/161 

and Unix man pages to determine the correct return values and error codes for each syscall, and checked kern/errno.h and 

kern/errmsg.h to ensure that the system behaves consistently with expected error semantics.

As part of our next steps, we are planning to begin writing our own userspace test programs using the provided 

create-testbin.sh script. This will allow us to generate simple testbins (e.g., myprogram) under ~/os161/testbin to verify 

our system calls individually as we build them. We will also examine the existing automated tests and run them through 

./pa2-test.sh to identify potential issues early. We intend to study the source code of each automated test program 

(located under testbin/at-*) to understand precisely what behavior is being validated and to ensure that our implementations 

satisfy both functional and error-handling requirements. Once our initial syscall implementations compile cleanly, 

we will use both custom testbins and the automated tester to begin systematic debugging. 

We have also gone through the Design Considerations section of the assignment document and outlined a preliminary design 

strategy that aligns with the key questions raised.
